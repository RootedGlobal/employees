# XOXCO Minimum Viable Design Assets

When creating design assets at XOXCO, including things like wireframes, mockups, and prototypes,
care must be taken to present a clear, workable, realistic vision.

## Responsive Design

We must consider:

## Smartphones:

320px is the baseline for judging a smartphone design,
but all designs should scale logically up to roughly 600px.

## Tablet Portrait:
768 is the baseline for judging a portrait tablet design
but all designs should scale logically between 600 and 768,
and potentially between 768 and roughly 900px wide depending on the
specifics of the design.

## Tablet Landscape:
1024 is the baseline for judging a landscape tablet design,
but all designs should scale logically from roughly 900px wide
to 1200px wide.

This design should in almost all cases be identical to the desktop
design.

## Desktop:

Same parameters as tablet landscape.

## Large Desktop:

1200px and above.


## Visual Rhythm & Design Patterns

Equal padding

Logical groupings

## Cleanliness and Correctness

No glaring typos, cuss words or weird stuff
